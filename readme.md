ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, processes and validates it, applies ML-based analysis, and generates insight reports.

The pipeline is fully automated using Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) and includes email notifications for success/failure tracking.

Core :

1. Data Ingestion

Accept data from multiple sources: CSV, API endpoints, databases.

Handle multiple formats with validation.

Error handling for corrupted or missing data.

2. Data Processing

Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers, duplicates).

Feature engineering and data transformation.

Data quality checks and logging.

3. ML Analysis

Anomaly Detection: Statistical methods or Isolation Forest.

Clustering: Identify hidden patterns in data.

Time Series Analysis: Detect seasonality and trends (if applicable).

Calculate key metrics and statistical trends.

4. Automation & Scheduling

Automated pipeline execution using Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux).

Configurable processing intervals.

Email notifications on pipeline success/failure.

5. Output & Reporting

Generate automated HTML/PDF reports with charts and insights.

Export processed data to database or flat files.

Log all pipeline activities for traceability.
